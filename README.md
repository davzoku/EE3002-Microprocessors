# EE3002 Microprocessors

Taken in  Aug 17 - Dec 17
EE3002 is one of the core modules for any NTU EEE student.

This is my first time working with Assembly code and I must say it is quite intriguing to understand how low-level programming actually work.

This repo will contain practice algorithms, sample codes and my self exploration.
