# NTU EEE

This repo contains some of the practice algorithms, sample codes and my self exploration from the modules I have taken at NTU.

## EE3002 Microprocessors
*in Assembly and C*

(Aug 17 - Dec 17)

Lecturer: Dr Chan Chee Keong, Tutor: Dr Faeyz Karim

EE3002 is one of the core modules for any NTU EEE student.

This is my first time working with Assembly code and I must say it is quite intriguing to understand how low-level programming actually work.
